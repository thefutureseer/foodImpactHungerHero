# Let's explore and rate each category of food preservatives based on their common usage and impact (ranging from 0 to 1000). Remember that these scores are relative and based on the factors we discussed in the readMe.md :

1. **Antioxidants**:
   - These compounds prevent food spoilage caused by oxidation.
   - Examples: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), Vitamin E (tocopherols), BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene).
   - **Rating**: Moderate impact on satiety due to their antioxidant properties.
   - **Satiety Index Score**: Approximately **400** (example value).

2. **Antimicrobials**:
   - Antimicrobial agents inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
   - Examples: Sodium benzoate, sorbic acid, and natamycin.
   - **Rating**: Moderate impact on satiety; essential for food safety.
   - **Satiety Index Score**: Approximately **600** (example value).

3. **Nitrites and Nitrates**:
   - Used primarily in cured meats (e.g., bacon, ham, sausages) to preserve color and prevent bacterial growth.
   - **Rating**: Low impact on satiety; mainly for preservation.
   - **Satiety Index Score**: Approximately **800** (example value).

4. **Sulfites**:
   - Prevent browning and microbial growth.
   - Found in dried fruits, wine, and some processed foods.
   - **Rating**: Low impact on satiety; potential sensitivity in some individuals.
   - **Satiety Index Score**: Approximately **700** (example value).

5. **Salt and Sugar**:
   - Act as natural preservatives.
   - Used in pickling, curing, and preserving fruits.
   - **Rating**: Moderate impact on satiety; high concentrations inhibit microbial growth.
   - **Satiety Index Score**: Approximately **500** (example value).

6. **Natural Preservatives**:
   - Derived from plants, animals, fungi, and algae.
   - Examples: Rosemary extract, honey, and vinegar.
   - **Rating**: Moderate impact on satiety; natural and beneficial.
   - **Satiety Index Score**: Approximately **550** (example value).
