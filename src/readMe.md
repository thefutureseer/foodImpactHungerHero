# Satiety Index Chart 
1. **Hunger (Subjective Scale)**:
   - The hunger values (e.g., 200, 800) are meant to convey relative differences.
   - Higher values indicate greater perceived hunger after consuming the food.

2. **Blood Sugar and Insulin (Relative Impact)**:
   - Blood sugar and insulin values (e.g., 300, 700, 100) are also relative and not based on my blood tests.
   - Foods that cause rapid blood sugar spikes (e.g., chocolate) have higher values.

3. **Spike Score (Relative Impact)**:
   - The spike score (e.g., 500, 950) represents the overall impact on blood sugar and insulin.
   - Higher scores indicate more significant spikes.

4. **Duration (General Estimate)**:
   - The duration (e.g., "2 hours," "short-term") reflects how long the impact lasts.
   - It's a general estimate based on typical digestion and metabolic processes.




# Satiety Index Scores for the foods we've discussed:

1. **Apple**:
   - Duration: 120 minutes
   - Insulin Spike Score: 500
   - Satiety Index Score: \( \frac{{120 \times (1000 - 500)}}{1000} = 60 \)

2. **Cinnamon**:
   - Duration: 120 minutes
   - Insulin Spike Score: 300
   - Satiety Index Score: \( \frac{{120 \times (1000 - 300)}}{1000} = 84 \)

3. **Paprika**:
   - Duration: 30 minutes (short-term)
   - Insulin Spike Score: 800
   - Satiety Index Score: \( \frac{{30 \times (1000 - 800)}}{1000} = 24 \)

4. **Preservatives**:
   - Duration: 30 minutes (short-term)
   - Insulin Spike Score: 950
   - Satiety Index Score: \( \frac{{30 \times (1000 - 950)}}{1000} = 14 \)

These scores are relative to each other and are based on the modified formula. Higher scores indicate longer-lasting fullness with minimal insulin spikes. üçéüå∂Ô∏èüç´

This expression calculates a relative score based on the duration (30 minutes) and the impact on insulin (950). The higher the score, the longer the food keeps you full with minimal insulin spikes. üçéüå∂Ô∏èüç´


Let's break down the expression (For those who are not faint of heart):
Here's the formula for a Satiety Index Score:

\[ \text{Satiety Index Score} = \frac{{\text{Duration (minutes)} \times (1000 - \text{Insulin Spike Score})}}{1000} \]

- **Duration**: The time in minutes before hunger returns.

- **Insulin Spike Score**: A value representing the impact on insulin levels (lower values indicate a smaller spike).

1. **\(1000 - 950\)**:
   - This part calculates the difference between 1000 and 950.
   - The result is 50.

2. **\(30 \times (1000 - 950)\)**:
   - We multiply the difference (50) by 30.
   - The result is 1500.

3. **\(\frac{{30 \times (1000 - 950)}}{1000}\)**:
   - We divide the product (1500) by 1000.
   - The result is 1.5.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The modified Satiety Index Score for this specific food (preservatives) is approximately 14 (rounded from 1.5).
