# Satiety Index Chart 
1. **Hunger (Subjective Scale)**:
   - The hunger values (e.g., 200, 800) are meant to convey relative differences.
   - Higher values indicate greater perceived hunger after consuming the food.

2. **Blood Sugar and Insulin (Relative Impact)**:
   - Blood sugar and insulin values (e.g., 300, 700, 100) are also relative and not based on my blood tests.
   - Foods that cause rapid blood sugar spikes (e.g., chocolate) have higher values.

3. **Spike Score (Relative Impact)**:
   - The spike score (e.g., 500, 950) represents the overall impact on blood sugar and insulin.
   - Higher scores indicate more significant spikes.

4. **Duration (General Estimate)**:
   - The duration (e.g., "2 hours," "short-term") reflects how long the impact lasts.
   - It's a general estimate based on typical digestion and metabolic processes.

This expression calculates a relative score based on the duration (30 minutes) and the impact on insulin (950). The higher the score, the longer the food keeps you full with minimal insulin spikes. 🍎🌶️🍫


Let's break down the expression (For those who are not faint of heart):

1. **\(1000 - 950\)**:
   - This part calculates the difference between 1000 and 950.
   - The result is 50.

2. **\(30 \times (1000 - 950)\)**:
   - We multiply the difference (50) by 30.
   - The result is 1500.

3. **\(\frac{{30 \times (1000 - 950)}}{1000}\)**:
   - We divide the product (1500) by 1000.
   - The result is 1.5.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The modified Satiety Index Score for this specific food (preservatives) is approximately 14 (rounded from 1.5).
